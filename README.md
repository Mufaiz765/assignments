Q2 : ASCII character set vs UTF 8 charter set vs UTF 16 charter set?
[A] : ASCII character set vs UTF 8 charter set vs UTF 16 charter set
The ASCII character set is a basic character encoding standard using 7 bits to represent 128 characters, including English letters, numerals, and common symbols.
UTF-8 and UTF-16 are both Unicode-based character encodings. Unicode is a standardized character set that aims to represent most of the world's written languages. Here's a brief comparison:

ASCII:

7-bit encoding.
Represents basic English characters and symbols.

UTF-8:

Variable-width encoding (1 to 4 bytes).
Compatible with ASCII for the first 128 characters.
Widely used for web pages and in many software applications.

UTF-16:

Fixed-width encoding (2 or 4 bytes).
Requires more space than UTF-8 for many characters.
Commonly used in programming languages and operating systems.

UTF-8 is often preferred for its space efficiency and compatibility with ASCII, while UTF-16 is used in environments where fixed-width characters are beneficial or when dealing with languages with more extensive character sets. The choice between them depends on factors like storage efficiency, language requirements, and system compatibility.
